            Stormtroopers have no names, only designations, comprised of letters and numbers. Their faces are never revealed to the public or their enemies, making them impersonal automatons with a merciless robot-like nature. They began as clones, created in the cloning facilities on Kamino from the genetic template of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, with the sole purpose of becoming a Grand Army of the Republic. When the Republic was eventually redesigned as the first Galactic Empire by Chancellor Palpatine, the Clone Troopers were conscripted into the Imperial Army and became the first Stormtroopers. It wouldn’t be until their accelerated-aging process made them too old to serve in the Stomrtrooper's ranks and forced the Empire to start using human-born recruits. Ironically, the identical resemblance of their armor and lack of individuality meant no one knew the difference.

        Scout Troopers have the lightest armor of the Stormtrooper Corps variants, which allows for greater flexibility and agility as they weave through the dense foliage of Endor on their 74-Z speeder bikes. Known for their excellent marksmanship, they carried E-11 long-range blaster pistols, and when the occasion called for it, shock grenades. Unlike other Stormtroopers, their helmets could be retracted up, allowing the trooper’s face to be visible. Scout Troopers were considered to be more independent and adaptable than their Stormtrooper counterparts, largely because of their remote missions in the field that required them to adapt to their terrain and think on their feet.

        Fett was paid a considerable sum and allowed to have one unaltered clone to be his son (which eerily looked exactly like he did as a child). All other of the clones’ growth was accelerated, so that hundreds of thousands of clones could be fully mature by the time they were needed. Their first taste of war was during the Battle of Geonosis in Attack of the Clones, the conflict that started the Clone Wars. They would serve the Republic valiantly until the inhibitor chips secretly placed in their neocortexes by Darth Sidious were engaged to execute Order 66, which resulted in the extermination of the Jedi Order in Revenge of the Sith.

        The Stormtrooper ranks were once populated by clones. At the end of the Clone Wars, the Clone Troopers that had once fought alongside Jedi Knights as part of the Grand Army of the Republic became the first Stormtroopers and enforced their Emperor’s will on any world that resisted Imperial rule. The advanced aging process of the clones eventually meant that they would have to be retired. Since a single legion of Stormtroopers needed 12,800 recruits, human-born conscripts took their place in the Imperial Amry's the ranks. Unlike most militaries, the Imperial Military taught its Stormtrooper cadets to leave fallen comrades in battle and to press on towards their objective whatever the cost. This often made them appear to their enemies as both foolish and terrifying.

        The riot control stormtrooper was a specialized variant of the standard stormtrooper of the First Order. Assigned to keep order on worlds within First Order territory, they were trained in riot-control tactics and given non-lethal equipment, such as lightweight composite betaplast ballistic riot shields and Z6 riot control batons (which were resistant to lightsabers). They also carried lethal weapons, such as the Sonn-Blas F-11D blaster rifle, in case situations spiraled out of control.
